# wtleditor
figure editor with wtl, c++ and D2D1

wtleditor is inherited from microsoft's hilo annotator program. It's a figure/text/animation editor written in c++ and wtl, using D2D1 graphic libraries.

There's still some hard-coding "file names" in the program so if you are building the code be sure to replacing them with files you specified.

The project is built with visual studio 2022.
